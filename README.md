# tCoNuT
TGen Copy Number Tool

# About
tCoNuT is a read depth based comparative copy number tool designed for whole genome, exome and panel NGS data. In addition, tCoNuT pipeline provides scripts for calculating B-allele frequencies.  B-allele frequencies can be used in conjuction with copy number to determine regions of LOH and provide additional evidence of a copy number change. The tool requires a control sample which can be matched or unmatched to the affected or tumor sample.

Please see tCoNuT wiki for a diagram of the tCoNuT workflow.
